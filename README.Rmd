# tutorial.package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tutorial.package is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of tutorial.package like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tutorial.package)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Create a numeric array of length 10
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Add random white noise to x during training
x_train <- AnalysisFunction(x, training = TRUE)

# Check the result
print(x_train)
# Output: [1] 0.2671259 2.1374656 2.1014392 4.7121023 4.1662397 6.2558626 7.7542864 8.8569784 8.8682297 9.4225326

# Return the original x during inference
x_test <- AnalysisFunction(x, training = FALSE)

# Check the result
print(x_test)
# Output: [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
